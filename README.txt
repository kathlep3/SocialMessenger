Assignment 5

In this assignment I have multiple files. The file ds_protocol.py has multiple functions from a3.py 
and is used to extract json responses to return a namedtuple, and a new directmessage function which 
can result in three client messages, like sending a message, requesting an unread message, and all messages. 
Working with this file is ds_messenger which has multiple classes holding variables to be resused. 
In DirectMessenger it has three functions, a send direct message function, a retreive new messages function, 
and a retrieve all messages function. Profile.py is extended to add friends and messages in a list. Both ds_messenger 
and ds_protocol each have their corresponding test file using unittest. a5.py is the gui file.
